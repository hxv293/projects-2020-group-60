# Data analysis project 

In this Project we want to examine the correlation between the total assets of pension funds in Denmark and the share index, in the period 2000-2016. We expect to find a strong correlation between these variables, as equity tends to be the largest form of assets pension funds own. A higher share index would increase the value of the shareholders equity thereby increasing the amount of total assets of pension funds. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb].

This **loades two datasets**: 

Data for pension funds is found from https://www.statbank.dk/MPK49
Data for share index is found from https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/selectvarval/define.asp?PLanguage=0&subword=tabsel&MainTable=MPK13&PXSId=163290&tablestyle=&ST=SD&buttons=0

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
